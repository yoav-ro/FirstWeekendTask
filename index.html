            <p>No matter what your experience level is, you should use <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com" target="_blank">PCPartPicker</a>. It not only has everything you need
                to buy, it also lets you build your PC piece by piece right there on the website, making sure all your
                hardware will play nicely together. It even has a few example builds you can tweak to your liking.</p>
            <p>Regardless of what kind of PC you’re building (home-office or gaming), the components you need are going
                to be the same. You’ll need a motherboard, a central processing unit (CPU), storage, memory, a power
                supply, a case, and a monitor. The only thing you might not need if you're mostly using this PC for
                home-office tasks is a GPU (graphics processing unit), but it's necessary for photo or video editing and
                gaming. That’s a lot of stuff. Here’s a little breakdown of what each component does, along with some
                hardware recommendations.</p>
            <p>But before diving in, you should know that there’s a worldwide shortage of PC components right now,
                particularly with graphics cards, and prices overall keep rising. If parts aren’t available, the best
                advice we can give is to wait. Things will eventually get back to normal. </p>

            <p>Every other component plugs into this circuit board. It’s the highway they use to communicate and
                collaborate. They come in different sizes and configurations, and each one looks a little different, but
                they all fill the same function. One thing to look out for: Make sure you know which processor you want
                to go with before you buy a motherboard. Motherboards come in a couple of flavors, but the most
                important thing to know is what kind of socket it has. </p>
            <p>There are basically two kinds, LGA and AM. You'll always see them listed with a number after them, like
                LGA1150 or AM3. The exact numbers after the LGA and AM portions of these socket names will change over
                time, to indicate which generation of Intel or AMD chips they support, but the current standards as of
                2021 (which will work with the latest chips from either maker) are LGA1200 for Intel and AM4 for AMD.
            </p>
            <p>Motherboards also come in a couple of sizes, the most common being ATX (or “full size”). That’s what I
                generally recommend, especially if this is your first build. Your PC case will list which size
                motherboard it supports, so make sure they match up.</p>

            <p>This is the brain of your computer. It sockets directly into the motherboard, and it’s the single most
                important component of your PC. But that doesn’t mean it has to be the most expensive. We’ll get to that
                later. If the CPU doesn't mention including thermal paste, make sure to get some. Don't eat it. I know
                it looks tasty, but it's not actually food. </p>

            <header class="section-header">Graphics Card (GPU)</header>
            <p>If you’ll be playing games on this PC, you’ll need a graphics processing unit (also called a graphics
                card). This is a specialized processor that’s designed and optimized for handling visual data like the
                graphics in games. It's also used in video and photo editing and other graphics-intensive tasks. These
                cards are tough to find in stock (or at a reasonable price) at the moment, so you may have to wait a
                while.</p>

            <p>This is your PC’s walk-in closet. This is where you store all your files, your games, your movies, your
                documents, your photos, your everything. You can always add more storage later if you need it.</p>

            <header class="section-header">Memory (RAM)</header>
            <p>You’ll see a lot of the same terms when you’re looking at memory and storage, but they’re very different.
                Memory is more like that one table you toss things on to deal with later. It’s scratch paper; it’s
                short-term. It’s very important, though, because software uses memory to cache (temporarily store) data
                in a place it can be retrieved very quickly.</p>

            <header class="section-header">Power Supply (PSU)</header>
            <p>Your power supply unit is a little box that keeps the electricity running to every component. It
                determines how quick and powerful your PC can be. The faster it is, the more power it needs, and you
                always want to have a little more than you need, just in case. Just like GPUs, PSUs are also a little
                hard to find right now.</p>

            <header class="section-header">Case</header>
            <p>Your case is just what it sounds like. It’s a metal box. It might be covered in glass panels and etched
                aluminum, but inside it’s just a big metal box that holds everything together. Make sure you match it up
                with your motherboard size. For example, if you have an ATX motherboard, you need an ATX (or “full
                size”) case. </p>
